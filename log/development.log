  Parameters: {"commit"=>"Create New", "post"=>{"body"=>"  CAMCUDAF is a non-profit making, non-violent and non-partisan association which serves the needs and provides information for citizens of Cameroon living in Finland as well as friends of Cameroon interested in learning about our culture and way of life. With the number of Cameroonians in Finland growing each year CAMCUDAF is well situated to provide first hand information to its members and well-wishers.\r\n\r\nCAMCUDAF has as goals to push for success of its members, the Cameroonian community in Finland, our beloved country Cameroon and the world at large. Through this site, you will be able to follow some of our projects and activities. You will also find some useful links about life in Finland and Cameroon and also our current events update. Feel free to contact us with your feedback or questions using the links provided. We look forward to collaborating with you.\r\nHumble beginnings\r\n\r\nCommitted to forging a spirit of oneness and solidarity, in this rather far-off country, a few dedicated Cameroonians living in Finland in 2002 came up with the idea of forming an association that would bring all Cameroonians living in Finland together. Firstly, to get Cameroonians together and secondly, to promote our rich and unique cultural heritage in this part of the world. These objectives led to the birth of Cameroon Cultural and Development Association in Finland (CAMCUDAF). From its timid beginnings of just a handful of members, the Association is today a full fledged, legally recognized and registered entity with a membership of about a hundred comprising of Cameroonians and well-wishers from diverse professional, religious and ethnic backgrounds. Therefore, our present membership does not only comprise of Cameroonians, but of both Finns and other nationals. In far-off Finland, CAMCUDAF is essentially, the common rallying point for all Cameroonians living here, far from home and family.\r\n\r\nOver the years, we have built a solidarity and network that have helped Cameroonians feel a sense of affiliation and relief necessary for persons living in an out-of-the-way and cold country as Finland. Though with limited resources, CAMCUDAF has worked to build real partnerships both between Cameroonians and with the Finnish society and state institutions. We participate in many socio-cultural activities on invitation from Finnish authorities, as well as organise our own activities (such as national Day celebrations) to publicize Cameroon and enlighten the Finnish community on our country. Although a great deal has been accomplished, we are constantly committed to doing more for the enhancement of the relationship between Cameroon and Finland.\r\n\r\nOur ultimate goal is to get this relationship to the government-to- government level; for we recognise that both countries stand to benefit a lot from such improved ties.

Cameroon too, with its touristy attractions and vast natural resources will be a viable partner for Finland. With this in mind, we strive to push for this relationship to materialize. In the absence of any official diplomatic relations between Cameroon and Finland, CAMCUDAF is virtually the only window through which Cameroon is seen here. We never miss an opportunity to promote our motherland; be it at Cameroonian student’s graduation ceremonies, “born-houses”, National Day Celebrations (20th May) or End-of-Year parties. Therefore, we push for a better understanding of Cameroon in the hope that some day we may be able to look back and say that it was all worth it.

Humble beginnings

Committed to forging a spirit of oneness and solidarity, in this rather far-off country, a few dedicated Cameroonians living in Finland in 2002 came up with the idea of forming an association that would bring all Cameroonians living in Finland together. Firstly, to get Cameroonians together and secondly, to promote our rich and unique cultural heritage in this part of the world. These objectives led to the birth of Cameroon Cultural and Development Association in Finland (CAMCUDAF). From its timid beginnings of just a handful of members, the Association is today a full fledged, legally recognized and registered entity with a membership of about a hundred comprising of Cameroonians and well-wishers from diverse professional, religious and ethnic backgrounds. Therefore, our present membership does not only comprise of Cameroonians, but of both Finns and other nationals. In far-off Finland, CAMCUDAF is essentially, the common rallying point for all Cameroonians living here, far from home and family.

Over the years, we have built a solidarity and network that have helped Cameroonians feel a sense of affiliation and relief necessary for persons living in an out-of-the-way and cold country as Finland. Though with limited resources, CAMCUDAF has worked to build real partnerships both between Cameroonians and with the Finnish society and state institutions.

  Parameters: {"commit"=>"Save changes", "post"=>{"body"=>"änen isänsä rakensi yli 40 vuotta sitten. Se peittyy lähes kauttaaltaan kiiltävälehtiseen villiviiniköynnökseen, jonka kasvuvimmalta vain ikkunat ovat jääneet paljaiksi. Ne kimmeltävät ilmeettöminä tiheän vehreyden keskeltä ehosteenaan monen väriset pelargoniat.\r\n– Köynnös eristää, eli sen ansiosta talo on kesäkuumalla viileämpi eikä kylmene syksyllä kovin nopeasti, Štursová kertoo. Hänen köynnökseen kietoutunut kotinsa komistelee pientaloalueella, jossa kauniita rakennuksia ja puutarhoja riittää: on saksalaistyyppistä alppikotia ja tyypillistä tšekkiläistä rinneratkaisua. Jokaisen talon piha kertoo omaa tarinaansa. Itse asiassa Vrchlabín vuoristokaupungin pientaloalue on todellinen aarreaitta, jossa riittää ihasteltavaa ylämäkiä pelkäämättömälle kotipuutarhurille. Koristeellisiin ja muodokkaisiin taloihin on talletettu vuosikymmenten kokemuksia ja sukujen historiaa. Yksi koti ei muistuta toista, vaan jokainen on yksilö.\r\nPihat pursuilevat kasveja, istutuksia ja viljelmiä hyvin erilaisin sommitteluin. Perennat, puut ja pensaat ovat saaneet kasvaa sijoillaan vuosia, jopa vuosikymmeniä. Pienehköille tonteille on mahdutettu monia erilaisia lajikkeita, ja keittiöpuutarhalle sekä yrttimaalle on raivattu omat palstansa. Taloja pihoineen näyttäisi yhdistävän vain yksi piirre: joka ikkunaa koristavat erisävyiset pelargoniat leveissä kukkalaatikoissa – ihan niin kuin Štursovánkin talossa.\r\n\r\nEtupihan katseenpysäyttäjät\r\nPortin pielen katseenvangitsija on monen neliömetrin kivikkopuutarha, jota talon emäntä on rakentanut lähes 30 vuotta. Sieltä pilkistävät mehitähdet, maksaruohot, rikot ja muut kivikon matalat kasvit. Erikokoiset perennat, kuten monenmoiset liljakasvit, tuovat kokonaisuuteen ryhtiä, rytmiä ja väriä. – Monivuotiset ruohot ovat erittäin tyypillinen osa tškkiläistä puutarhaa, Štursová mainitsee. Kivikon murikat Štursová ja hänen miehensä ovat kuljettaneet läheisiltä vuorilta sekä kukkuloilta, peltojen reunamilta ja tuttujen pihoilta pois tieltä. Niistä muodostuu nyt soljuva kokonaisuus, jota vähään tyytyvät kasvit täplittävät.\r\nSisäänkäynnin toinen katseenvangitsija sijoittuu portin toiseen pieleen, jossa tanakat aloe verat ylpeilevät eksoottisen ruukkupuutarhan valtiattarina. Ne on asteltu kivimuurin tyylikkääksi rivistöksi. Matalammat tuhatkaunot esittelevät punertavia ja kellertäviä kukintojaan vaalean punan sävyisten daalioiden keskellä. Niiden takana ylvästelee emäntäänsä korkeammaksi kasvanut oleanteri, jossa muutama vaalea kukka kätkeytyy napakoiden lehtien lomaan.\r\n– Botanistimieheni oli Algeriassa kukkanäyttelyssä kymmenen vuotta sitten ja toi nämä meille siemeninä. Näin upeasti ne ovat viihtyneet! Oleanterit on istutettu aloe verojen tapaan ruukkuihin, jotta niiden kasvupaikka voidaan muuttaa kelien kylmetessä. Talvi saapuu Pohjois-Tšekkin samoihin aikoihin kuin Suomeen, ja silloin eksoottisen kasvit kiikutetaan autotallin lämpöön.\r\n\r\nMuuri elementistä\r\nTalon takapihan ensimmäinen näkymä on raskas ja massiivinen muuri, joka ei vielä istu muun puutarhan vehreyteen. Se on rakennettu isoista pyöräreunaisista elementeistä, jotka ladottiin lomittain kaltevaksi tueksi pihan eri tasojen välille. Elementit on täytetty kasvuaineksella, eli kussakin on syvennys mullalle. Jokaisen keskeltä pyrkii esiin maanpeitekasvi, kuten pikkutalvio. Kahdessa kolmessa vuodessa muurin yläreunan kasvusto kohoaa pikkupehkoiksi ja roikkumaan tarkoitetut lajikkeet rynnivät alas peittäen synkät kivireunukset alleen.\r\n– Tässä oli aiemmin muuri, joka tehtiin samoihin aikoihin, kun talo rakennettiin. Se luhistui pala kerrallaan. Nyt teimme jykevän ratkaisun, joka kestää taas ainakin seuraavat 40 vuotta, Štursová iloitsee. Muurin yläpuolella avautuu patio, jonka rakentaminen on vielä kesken. Siihen tulee aikanaan grillausalue ja kesäkeittiö suomalaiseen tapaan.
